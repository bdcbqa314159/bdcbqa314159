# std::cout<<"Hello, World!"; 👋

Hey there, my name is Bernardo and I started working as a quant.

I am interested in ***Mathematics***, ***Computer Science***, ***Financial Modelling*** & ***Problem Solving***.
I am currently working on numerical methods, stochastic calculus, credit derivatives & American Options.

Last topics covered / working on:
  - Working with F# & CMake.
  - Derivatives pricing (very basic).
  - Numerical Analysis.
  - Data Structures & Algorithms.
  - XVA.

I make projects mixing the resources I could read/work on the fields I cited above, for most of them in ***c++*** & ***python***.

I hope you will find something useful in here 😊.
