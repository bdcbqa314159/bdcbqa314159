# std::cout<<"Hello, World!"👋

Hey there, my name is Bernardo and I started working as a quant.

I am interested in ***Mathematics***, ***Computer Science***, ***Financial Modelling*** & ***Problem Solving***.
I am currently learning about XVA and trying to mix it with the things I already know.

I make projects mixing the resources I could read/work on the fields I cited above, for most of them in ***c++*** & ***python***.

I hope you will find something useful in here 😊.
