# std::cout<<"Hello, World!"; 👋

Hey there, my name is Bernardo and we could say that I am a quant.

I am interested in ***Mathematics***, ***Computer Science***, ***Financial Modelling*** & ***Problem Solving***.
Currently I am blending all the work cumulated by reading and solving books. It is about pricing derivatives, mathematics,
c++ and python.
Since the beginning I tried to document my work, now it is time to center it and to simplify the projects I have been doing.
This is made as we could say "sans tambours ni trompettes" :)

I hope you will find something useful in here 😊.
